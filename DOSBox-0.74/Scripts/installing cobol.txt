COBOL is not particularly popular on Linux but there are compilers available. One of these is open-cobol.

First step is to check if it's installed on your system: it probably isn't.

whereis cobc; which cobc
cobc:
If like my system it is not installed you can install it with

sudo apt-get install open-cobol
And to check its installed whereis cobc; which cobc

cobc: /usr/bin/cobc /usr/bin/X11/cobc /usr/share/man/man1/cobc.1.gz
/usr/bin/cobc
Now lets write our first program with any text editor.

IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. HELLO-WORLD.
*> simple hello world program
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY 'Hello world!'.
    STOP RUN.
save this as "helloworld.cbl"

We can now compile it with cobc -free -x -o helloworld helloworld.cbl

On my system I see this

$ cobc -free -x -o helloworld helloworld.cbl
/tmp/cob3837_0.c: In function ‘HELLO_2DWORLD_’:

A few warnings -- but no errors test with ./helloworld

Hello World!
It works.

Alternative (fixed format):

       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. HELLO-WORLD.
      * simple hello world program
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           DISPLAY 'Hello world!'.
           STOP RUN.
save this as "helloworld.cob" and compile it with cobc helloworld.cob (run with cobcrun helloworld.

If you want to remove the warnings from the C compiler: download a current GnuCOBOL 2.x snapshot (which has no updated package yet) and build it yourself (needs an additional apt-get bison flex libdb-dev curses-dev).
